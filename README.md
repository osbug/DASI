Data Analysis and Statistical Inference Project

This is the peer reviewed project I did for the Coursera course Data Analysis and Statistical Inference. It was an introduction not only to statistics, but also R and R Markdown.

For this project I pulled information from the Lahman Baseball Database. The databse contains information on players from the late 1800s to now. It is a relational database, which increased the complexity of my initial R project, but was a great learning experience. Unfortunately I spent more time than I planned on that end of the project and not enough time making it look nice. I plan to go back and clean up the project after the class is done, possibly with an increased skill set (from DASI and the Johns Hopkins sequence of classes that just started). The first step being setting up my first git hub repo and using this project to learn Git and Github. Already I see a few things that can be done cleaner within R (including the fact that there is actually a Lahman package for R which might make things easier). I don't see a similar analysis anwhere on the net, so I think it would be worthwhile pusrusing this a bit more and cleaning it up.

The project itself is a comparison of the differences in three different subsets of baseball players: Those who were inducted into the Hall of Fame, those who were nominated for the Hall of Fame but not inducted, and players who played ten years (the minimum amount needed to be eligible for the Hall of Fame) but were neither nominated nor inducted for the Hall of Fame. I compare the rate of All Star Game appearances across the population to see if there is any correlation between All Star Game appearances and Hall of Fame Status. There was some data cleaning that I did that is documented in the project.
